Subject: [PATCH 2/3] Add the clock bindings to omap3.dtsi that were made
 available through the omap-clock device tree driver. Adds the pll1 clock
 handles which drives the CPU frequency, and subsequently the ability to
 change its clock speed, and also add the system reference clock. Originally
 found here: http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1304.1/04074.html
